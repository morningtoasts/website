            -    One man who belongs to this world was born with a love, but lonely like the embers of fire surrounded by the mist. He developed a talent for seeking knowledge, so people called him talented. That makes him feel special. He tried many things and was pretty good at all of them, but one day, he met that girl. She made him stuck with her. All of her. The man gave up most things just for her. Friends, Family, Talent, Life. But eventually their relationship had ended. HE LOST HER, and He lost everything. He was thinking about what he had done and the cost he had to pay. Sooner or later, that girl got her new man while the man still had nothing, still thinking about her every second that passed.  And that’s me — Jay (Kei)
            <p class = "Second">
 I was stuck in the mist now, no more the light of faith, no more the talent I used to have. Nothing left in this hollow vessel. She took everything from me. I did everything I could, but even my talent couldn’t hold her hair. I’m just not good enough. We are both doing for the same person, which is her, and there, I'm the only one left myself.
